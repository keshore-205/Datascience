# Fake and True News Detection Project:

Project don by HARIKRISHNAN V

The code will produce evaluation metrics and provide a prediction for whether the given news is true or false based on the trained model.

## Results

We evaluated each classifier's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are documented in the project files.

## Model Deployment

Once you are satisfied with the performance of a particular classifier, you can deploy it in a real-world application or integrate it into a larger system for automatic fake news detection.
